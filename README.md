# PHP Modern

**IMPORTANT:** Development of this package has stopped now that standard Sublime packages are Open Source. I'll be integrating changes in the [official PHP package](https://github.com/sublimehq/Packages/tree/master/PHP) (everybody wins, me first). Thanks jbrooksuk for the suggestion in issue #17.

---------------

Sublime Text syntax definition for current PHP version. It goes well with its companion theme [Baara Dark](https://github.com/jobedom/sublime-baara-dark).

The objective of this package is keeping PHP language definition up to date with PHP
syntax changes. Notice the PHP code in the screenshot is pure gobbledygook.
The font used in the capture is Fresco, one of my own.

This is a work in progress. Pull requests are welcome.

## Installation

The recommended way to install and keep up to date is to install it via
[Package Control]. Once you have installed Package Control, open it via
`Preferences -> Package Control` and click on
`Package Control: Install Package`. Type `PHP Modern` into the search
box, then hit enter or click on the result to install.
